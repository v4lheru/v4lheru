# Hi there, I'm Uros Pesic! 👋

**AI Workflow Architect | Automation Engineer | Builder**

> I build things that solve problems - whether that's full-stack applications, automation systems, or AI-powered workflows. Not a traditional software engineer, but I ship production code daily using Claude Code, n8n, Supabase, and whatever else gets the job done. Currently at Semrush architecting AI workflows.

## 🚀 Profile

Started in technical support, moved through business analysis, and now I design and build solutions at scale. When generative AI emerged, I went deep—prompt engineering, workflow automation, and integrating LLMs into real business processes. I specialize in making incompatible systems talk to each other and building the tools that teams actually need.
