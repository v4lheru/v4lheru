# Hi there, I'm V4lheru! 👋

Im currently working as a Business Analyst/Solution Consultant in Supply Chain.  My goal is to build a strong portfolio in Prompt Engineering and Python, which i started both recently.

Plan is next: Start learning Python and pass PCEP (PCAP by EOY). Continue growing on  BA and SA path. And get certified as Prompt Engineer to best utilize all the 
tools at my disposal. This Git is a portfolio place.

I have no prior programing experience.

Idea is, have a repo for everything im starting to learn, and add all interesting things I do, as I learn, they will get more interesting and relevant.

## About Me 🌱

- 🔭 I'm currently learning Python from scratch. Jack of all trades, master of none (technical at least). I plan to change that with Prompt Eng.
- 🌟 I'm interested in Prompt Engineering. I think that would be my tool to combine all other skills.
- 🤔 I'm looking for help with mastering Python and creating an impressive portfolio
